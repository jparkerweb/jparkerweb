## Hi there 😄

🐙 Checkout my GitHub projects here: https://github.com/jparkerweb

🧑‍💻 Here are a few of my published npm packages:
- [🍱 Semantic Chunking](https://www.npmjs.com/package/semantic-chunking)  
  Semantically create chunks from large texts, which is useful for workflows involving large language models (LLMs).

- [🍶 LLM Distillery](https://www.npmjs.com/package/llm-distillery)  
  Use LLMs to distill large texts down to a manageable size by utilizing a map-reduce approach. This ensures that the text fits within a specified token limit, which is crucial when interfacing with Large Language Models (LLMs) in downstreams tasks.

- [🪨 Bedrock Wrapper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bedrock-wrapper)  
  Bedrock Wrapper is an npm package that simplifies the integration of existing OpenAI-compatible API objects with AWS Bedrock's serverless inference LLMs. Follow the steps below to integrate into your own application, or alternativly use the [🔀 Bedrock Proxy Endpoint](https://github.com/jparkerweb/bedrock-proxy-endpoint) project to spin up your own custom OpenAI server endpoint for even easier inference (using the standard baseUrl, and apiKey params).
